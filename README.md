- 👋 Hi, I’m @FVPLare
- 👀 I’m interested in defining the code that will keep humanity in thrall as they compulsively snap their forefinger from "here" to "there" across the length of their smartphones again & again. For ever!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to digitize human reaction & impulse & choice for use as the base Trinary Set upon which my code shall be constructed.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I suppose you'll know who you are when I decide for you to "get the idea"
- 📫 How to reach me ... I guess...; just make yourself apparent by choosing your own purpose within the grand scheme of things can be utilized by my SDK/Algorithm in an 'Outside the  Box' 'Better than I've got' way.
